'Hello classmates. You all can call me KB. I am a junior in BSc. CS. I am taking this course to enhance my background in developing a full stack online application. I know somewhat of RDBMS as I learned about developing java applications with MySQL database back end with jconnectors in 11th and 12th grade, 6 years ago and I forgot most of it. I made an application for hotels industry as my final project in 12th grade final exams, though it could only be used offline and needed MySQL to be installed on that particular computer(windows, no osx cuz it wont support jconnectors) .I hope this course re enhances my ability and take it to online level. Been into computers since 2nd grade and into coding since 8th grade. Good luck everyone.'
